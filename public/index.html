                <h2>Club activities in high school</h2>
                <p>
                    This photo is from the opening ceremony of the last tournament of my high school club activity
                    career.
                    I was most passionate about baseball in high school.
                    I spent a lot of time to get to the national tournament in Japan.
                    As a result, I couldn't make it to the national tournament, but I was able to make a lot of
                    memories.

                <h2>Club activities in university</h2>
                <p>
                    This photo is a picture of my pitching in a university club activity.
                    I was more focused on having fun than I was in high school.
                    I was able to make a lot of friends and have a good time.
                    I was glad that I was able to continue baseball as a hobby in a university.

                <h2>My favorite baseball player</h2>
                <p>
                    This is a picture of Shohei Ohtani, MLB player for the Los Angeles dodgers.
                    He is a two-way player who can pitch and hit.
                    He is the most popular baseball player in Japan.
                    I respect him because He's not only a good baseball player, he's a good character.
                    I would like to see his games in the US someday.
